Hi Hamid.

I have an old domain with a bad website.

Domain is www.taglifting.com.au

It is currently in Wordpress.

We also have other seperate sites like www.taglifting.com.au/inspections
again this is wordpress

My question is;

can we change www.taglifting.com.au dns to go to an odoo instance we
currently have (ie replace www.tagbrm.com with www.taglifting.com.au ) yet
not disrupt the external wordpress sites like
www.taglifting.com.au/inspections

I await your answer on this and is it a relatively simple task for your
skills?

Anthony
