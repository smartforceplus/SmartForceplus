To whom it may concern,
I came across your site http://www.smallbiz.community and read that you
had an Australian Accounts module made for Odoo.

Currently I'm in a start-up process and looking at implementing Odoo
possibly on a home server to start with, however, it needs to be set up
for Australian accounts and Australian Payroll.

Is you module available and if so, at what price?

Regards,
Lance Bleakley
